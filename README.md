## Project Description

My app is called Herbaceous Flash Cards. A user visits a webpage that displays an image of a card with the name of a plant on it. The user can check their own answer against the card's answer by clicking on the card which reveals the therapeutic function of the plant. To view the next card the user will click on the next button. Instructions will be provided on the screen.

### Bonus:

If I can complete this project early, I would like to turn this into a fortune cookie app.
